Library Management System
This code implements a simple library management system in Java. It consists of three classes:

BookView: This class handles the user interface and interacts with the user to take input and display information.
BookController: This class manages the book data and performs operations like adding, searching, borrowing, returning, removing, and sorting books.
Book: This class represents a book object with attributes like author, title, ID, and availability status.
Here's a summary of the functionalities:

Adding books: Users can add new books by providing author, title, and ID. Duplicate entries are prevented.
Searching books: Users can search for books by author, title, or ID.
Borrowing books: Users can borrow available books by searching and marking them unavailable.
Returning books: Users can return borrowed books by searching and marking them available.
Removing books: Users can remove books by searching for available books and removing them from the list.
Sorting books: Users can sort books by ID, title, or author using a comparator interface.
Observations and potential improvements:

Error handling: The code lacks proper error handling for invalid user input or unexpected situations.
Data persistence: The code doesn't persist book data, meaning information is lost upon program termination. Implementing database integration or file storage would be beneficial.
User authentication: The current implementation allows anyone to access the system. Adding user authentication could improve security.
Enhancements: Additional features like displaying all books, generating reports, managing user accounts, and setting due dates for borrowed books could be implemented.
Overall, the code provides a basic foundation for a library management system. However, incorporating error handling, data persistence, and additional features would enhance its robustness and functionality.
